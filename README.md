API Challenge

I implemented four functions that sent HTTP requests to a site that expected a JSON file. 

reverse.py receives a string as input and returns the same string in reverse.
needle.py receives a dictionary of two items, needle and haystack. 
  needle contains a string while haystack contains an array of strings. 
  needle.py finds the needle string in the the haystack array and returns its index.
prefix.py receives a dictionary of two items, prefix (a string) and array (an array of strings).
  prefix.py returns an array containing onl items that do not begin with the prefix. 
dating.py receives a timestamp (in ISO 8601 datestamp format) and a time interval, 
  adds the time interval to the timestamp and returns the resulting timestamp.


To see each function in action, call "python <filename>"
